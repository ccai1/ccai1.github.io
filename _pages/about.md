  I work at [Cartesia AI](https://cartesia.ai), where I research and build SSMs for speech. 
  
  I recently graduated from MIT with my BS in math and computer science and MEng in computer science. At MIT, I worked at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) on using machine learning to find new [synthetic lethality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_lethality) pairs.
